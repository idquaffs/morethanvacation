        <h2>IT'S A TIME FOR...</h2>
        <p>The revitalizing tropical climes of Orlando are just part of Liki Tiki Village Resort’s appeal. This much-traveled-to destination near the Tropic of Cancer and a go-to notch on the Sun Belt attracts visitors year-round boasting the best entertainment for the entire family. The operative words here are “entire family.” Resorts, especially of this size and caliber, usually cater to the proclivities of single adults and couples. If children are even part of a resort’s purview, they’re either marginally considered or are relegated to an afterthought. Not so at the Liki Tiki Village.</p>
        <p>Here, families are the focus. From incomparable amenities, heated pools, ample, luxurious accommodations, and top-of-the-line exercise facilities, to the Polynesian-inspired water wonderland for the kids, you can be sure everyone on this excursion will be taken care of. What’s more, Disney World, SeaWorld, Wet n’ Wild Water Park, and Gatorland are just minutes away. Where else can you go to get closer to the ones you love and have some of the most fun together you’ve ever had as a family? That’s the real value of the Liki Tiki Village.</p>
